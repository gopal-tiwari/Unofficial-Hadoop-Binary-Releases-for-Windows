# Unofficial Apache Hadoop Binaries for Windows OS

This project aims to provide you an unofficial binary release of Apache Hadoop for Windows 64-bit platform. 

Hadoop provides native Windows support from version 2.2 and above, but for that we need to build it on our own, as official Apache Hadoop releases do not provide native Windows binaries.

Here you will find all Apache Hadoop binary distributions from & onwards version 2.2 for Windows platform. You can download it using the links given in the download section below or alternatively from the Releases section of my origional project repo [here](https://github.com/gopal-tiwari/Unofficial-Hadoop-Releases-for-Windows/releases).


### Compilation Process Followed
